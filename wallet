Contributing to Tixoncash Core
==================================

The Tixoncash Core project operates an open contributor model where anyone is
welcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, testing
and patches. This document explains the practical process and guidelines for
contributing.

Firstly in terms of structure, there is no particular concept of "Core
developers" in the sense of privileged people. Open source often naturally
revolves around meritocracy where longer term contributors gain more trust from
the developer community. However, some hierarchy is necessary for practical
purposes. As such there are repository "maintainers" who are responsible for
merging pull requests as well as a "lead maintainer" who is responsible for the
release cycle, overall merging, moderation and appointment of maintainers.


Contributor Workflow
--------------------

The codebase is maintained using the "contributor workflow" where everyone
without exception contributes patch proposals using "pull requests". This
facilitates social contribution, easy testing and peer review.

To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:

  - Fork repository
  - Create topic branch
  - Commit patches

The project coding conventions in the [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md)
must be adhered to.

In general [commits should be atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Atomic_commit_convention)
and diffs should be easy to read. For this reason do not mix any formatting
fixes or code moves with actual code changes.

Commit messages should be verbose by default consisting of a short subject line
(50 chars max), a blank line and detailed explanatory text as separate
paragraph(s), unless the title alone is self-explanatory (like "Corrected typo
in init.cpp") in which case a single title line is sufficient. Commit messages should be
helpful to people reading your code in the future, so explain the reasoning for
your decisions. Further explanation [here](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

If a particular commit references another issue, please add the reference, for
example `refs #1234`, or `fixes #4321`. Using the `fixes` or `closes` keywords
will cause the corresponding issue to be closed when the pull request is merged.

Please refer to the [Git manual](https://git-scm.com/doc) for more information
about Git.

  - Push changes to your fork
  - Create pull request

The title of the pull request should be prefixed by the component or area that
the pull request affects. Valid areas as:

  - *Consensus* for changes to consensus critical code
  - *Docs* for changes to the documentation
  - *Qt* for changes to tixoncash-qt
  - *Minting* for changes to the minting code
  - *Net* or *P2P* for changes to the peer-to-peer network code
  - *RPC/REST* for changes to the RPC or REST APIs
  - *Scripts and tools* for changes to the scripts and tools
  - *Tests* for changes to the tixoncash unit tests or QA tests
  - *Trivial* should **only** be used for PRs that do not change generated
    executable code. Notably, refactors (change of function arguments and code
    reorganization) and changes in behavior should **not** be marked as trivial.
    Examples of trivial PRs are changes to:
    - comments
    - whitespace
    - variable names

@robbinhxb	Reply…
    - logging and messages
  - *Utils and libraries* for changes to the utils and libraries
  - *Wallet* for changes to the wallet code

Examples:

    Consensus: Add new opcode for BIP-XXXX OP_CHECKAWESOMESIG
    Net: Automatically create hidden service, listen on Tor
    Qt: Add feed bump button
    Trivial: Fix typo in init.cpp

If a pull request is specifically not to be considered for merging (yet) please
prefix the title with [WIP] or use [Tasks Lists](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#task-lists)
in the body of the pull request to indicate tasks are pending.

The body of the pull request should contain enough description about what the
patch does together with any justification/reasoning. You should include
references to any discussions (for example other tickets or mailing list
discussions).

At this stage one should expect comments and review from other contributors. You
can add more commits to your pull request by committing them locally and pushing
to your fork until you have satisfied all feedback.

Squashing Commits
---------------------------
If your pull request is accepted for merging, you may be asked by a maintainer
to squash and or [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) your commits
before it will be merged. The basic squashing workflow is shown below.

    git checkout your_branch_name
    git rebase -i HEAD~n
    # n is normally the number of commits in the pull
    # set commits from 'pick' to 'squash', save and quit
    # on the next screen, edit/refine commit messages
    # save and quit
    git push -f # (force push to GitHub)

If you have problems with squashing (or other workflows with `git`), you can
alternatively enable "Allow edits from maintainers" in the right GitHub
sidebar and ask for help in the pull request.

Please refrain from creating several pull requests for the same change.
Use the pull request that is already open (or was created earlier) to amend
changes. This preserves the discussion and review that happened earlier for
the respective change set.

The length of time required for peer review is unpredictable and will vary from
pull request to pull request.


Pull Request Philosophy
-----------------------

Patch sets should always be focused. For example, a pull request could add a
feature, fix a bug, or refactor code; but not a mixture. Please also avoid super
pull requests which attempt to do too much, are overly large, or overly complex
as this makes review difficult.


### Features

When adding a new feature, thought must be given to the long term technical debt
and maintenance that feature may require after inclusion. Before proposing a new
feature that will require maintenance, please consider if you are willing to
maintain it (including bug fixing). If features get orphaned with no maintainer
in the future, they may be removed by the Repository Maintainer.


### Refactoring

Refactoring is a necessary part of any software project's evolution. The
following guidelines cover refactoring pull requests for the project.

There are three categories of refactoring, code only moves, code style fixes,
code refactoring. In general refactoring pull requests should not mix these
three kinds of activity in order to make refactoring pull requests easy to
review and uncontroversial. In all cases, refactoring PRs must not change the
behavior of code within the pull request (bugs must be preserved as is).

Project maintainers aim for a quick turnaround on refactoring pull requests, so
where possible keep them short, un-complex and easy to verify.


"Decision Making" Process
-------------------------

The following applies to code changes to the Tixoncash Core project, and is not to be
confused with overall Tixoncash Network Protocol consensus changes.

Whether a pull request is merged into Tixoncash Core rests with the project merge
maintainers and ultimately the project lead.

Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general
principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will
judge the general consensus of contributors.

In general, all pull requests must:

  - have a clear use case, fix a demonstrable bug or serve the greater good of
    the project (for example refactoring for modularisation);
  - be well peer reviewed;
  - follow code style guidelines;

Patches that change Tixoncash consensus rules are considerably more involved than
normal because they affect the entire ecosystem and so must be preceded by
extensive discussions and clear detailing. While each case will be different,
one should be prepared to expend more time and effort than for other kinds of
patches because of increased peer review and consensus building requirements.


### Peer Review

Anyone may participate in peer review which is expressed by comments in the pull
request. Typically reviewers will review the code for obvious errors, as well as
test out the patch set and opine on the technical merits of the patch. Project
maintainers take into account the peer review when determining if there is
consensus to merge a pull request (remember that discussions may have been
spread out over GitHub, forums, email, and Slack discussions). The following
language is used within pull-request comments:

  - ACK means "I have tested the code and I agree it should be merged";
  - NACK means "I disagree this should be merged", and must be accompanied by
    sound technical justification (or in certain cases of copyright/patent/licensing
    issues, legal justification). NACKs without accompanying reasoning may be
    disregarded;
  - utACK means "I have not tested the code, but I have reviewed it and it looks
    OK, I agree it can be merged";
  - Concept ACK means "I agree in the general principle of this pull request";
  - Nit refers to trivial, often non-blocking issues.

Reviewers should include the commit hash which they reviewed in their comments.

Project maintainers reserve the right to weigh the opinions of peer reviewers
using common sense judgement and also may weight based on meritocracy: Those
that have demonstrated a deeper commitment and understanding towards the project
(over time) or have clear domain expertise may naturally have more weight, as
one would expect in all walks of life.

Where a patch set affects consensus critical code, the bar will be set much
higher in terms of discussion and peer review requirements, keeping in mind that
mistakes could be very costly to the wider community. This includes refactoring
of consensus critical code.

Where a patch set proposes to change the Tixoncash consensus, it must have been
discussed extensively on the forums and Slack, be accompanied by a widely
discussed Proposal and have a generally widely perceived technical consensus of being
a worthwhile change based on the judgement of the maintainers.

### Finding Reviewers

As most reviewers are themselves developers with their own projects, the review
process can be quite lengthy, and some amount of patience is required. If you find
that you've been waiting for a pull request to be given attention for several
months, there may be a number of reasons for this, some of which you can do something
about:

  - It may be because of a feature freeze due to an upcoming release. During this time,
    only bug fixes are taken into consideration. If your pull request is a new feature,
    it will not be prioritized until the release is over. Wait for release.
  - It may be because the changes you are suggesting do not appeal to people. Rather than
    nits and critique, which require effort and means they care enough to spend time on your
    contribution, thundering silence is a good sign of widespread (mild) dislike of a given change
    (because people don't assume *others* won't actually like the proposal). Don't take
    that personally, though! Instead, take another critical look at what you are suggesting
    and see if it: changes too much, is too broad, doesn't adhere to the
    [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md), is dangerous or insecure, is messily written, etc.
    Identify and address any of the issues you find. Then ask e.g. on Slack if someone could give
    their opinion on the concept itself.
  - It may be because your code is too complex for all but a few people. And those people
    may not have realized your pull request even exists. A great way to find people who
    are qualified and care about the code you are touching is the
    [Git Blame feature](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/). Simply
    find the person touching the code you are touching before you and see if you can find
    them and give them a nudge. Don't be incessant about the nudging though.
  - Finally, if all else fails, ask on Slack or elsewhere for someone to give your pull request
    a look. If you think you've been waiting an unreasonably long amount of time (month+) for
    no particular reason (few lines changed, etc), this is totally fine. Try to return the favor
    when someone else is asking for feedback on their code, and universe balances out.

Tixoncash Core integration/staging repository
=================================================

Tixoncash (TXCH) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision for Bitcoin. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies. Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by high-powered mining hardware. Tixoncash utilizes an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm, can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment. The Green Protocol offers a simple solution to Bitcoin sustainability issues and provides a faster, more scalable blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.

- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftTX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting providing for consensus based advancement of the current Masternode
  technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is secured
  with a collateral of 10,000 TXCH.

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_BOOST_PROGRAM_OPTIONS
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Test for program options library from the Boost C++ libraries. The macro
#   requires a preceding call to AX_BOOST_BASE. Further documentation is

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_BOOST_UNIT_TEST_FRAMEWORK
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Test for Unit_Test_Framework library from the Boost C++ libraries. The
#   macro requires a preceding call to AX_BOOST_BASE. Further documentation
#   is available at <http://randspringer.de/boost/index.html>.
#
#   This macro calls:
#
#     AC_SUBST(BOOST_UNIT_TEST_FRAMEWORK_LIB)
#
#   And sets:
#
#     HAVE_BOOST_UNIT_TEST_FRAMEWORK

#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Check whether the given FLAG works with the current language's compiler

#
#   ACTION-SUCCESS/ACTION-FAILURE are shell commands to execute on
#   success/failure.
#
#   If EXTRA-FLAGS is defined, it is added to the current language's default

#   the flags: "CFLAGS EXTRA-FLAGS FLAG".  This can for example be used to
#   force the compiler to issue an error when a bad flag is given.
#
#   NOTE: Implementation based on AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION. Please keep this

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_GCC_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE(ATTRIBUTE)
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro checks if the compiler supports one of GCC's function
#   attributes; many other compilers also provide function attributes with
#   the same syntax. Compiler warnings are used to detect supported
#   attributes as unsupported ones are ignored by default so quieting
#   warnings when using this macro will yield false positives.
#
#   The ATTRIBUTE parameter holds the name of the attribute to be checked.
#
#   If ATTRIBUTE is supported define HAVE_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_<ATTRIBUTE>.
#
#   The macro caches its result in the ax_cv_have_func_attribute_<attribute>
#   variable.
#
#   The macro currently supports the following function attributes:
#
#    alias
#    aligned
#    alloc_size
#    always_inline
#    artificial
#    cold
#    const
#    constructor
#    deprecated
#    destructor
#    dllexport
#    dllimport
#    error
#    externally_visible
#    flatten
#    format
#    format_arg
#    gnu_inline
#    hot
#    ifunc
#    leaf
#    malloc
#    noclone
#    noinline
#    nonnull
#    noreturn
#    nothrow
#    optimize
#    pure
#    unused
#    used
#    visibility
#    warning
#    warn_unused_result
#    weak
#    weakref
#
#   Unsuppored function attributes will be tested with a prototype returning
#   an int and not accepting any arguments and the result of the check might
#   be wrong or meaningless so use with care.

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PTHREAD([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro figures out how to build C programs using POSIX threads. It
#   sets the PTHREAD_LIBS output variable to the threads library and linker
#   flags, and the PTHREAD_CFLAGS output variable to any special C compiler
#   flags that are needed. (The user can also force certain compiler
#   flags/libs to be tested by setting these environment variables.)
#
#   Also sets PTHREAD_CC to any special C compiler that is needed for
#   multi-threaded programs (defaults to the value of CC otherwise). (This
#   is necessary on AIX to use the special cc_r compiler alias.)
#
#   NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these flags,
#   but also link it with them as well. e.g. you should link with
#   $PTHREAD_CC $CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS $LDFLAGS ... $PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS
#
#   If you are only building threads programs, you may wish to use these
#   variables in your default LIBS, CFLAGS, and CC:
#
#     LIBS="$PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS"
#     CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS"
#     CC="$PTHREAD_CC"
#
#   In addition, if the PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE thread-attribute constant
#   has a nonstandard name, defines PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE to that name
#   (e.g. PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED on AIX).
#
#   Also HAVE_PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT is defined if pthread is found and the
#   PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT symbol is defined when compiling with
#   PTHREAD_CFLAGS.
#
#   ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a threads library
#   is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it
#   is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action
#   will define HAVE_PTHREAD.
#
#   Please let the authors know if this macro fails on any platform, or if
#   you have any other suggestions or comments. This macro was based on work
#   by SGJ on autoconf scripts for FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/) (with help
#   from M. Frigo), as well as ac_pthread and hb_pthread macros posted by
#   Alejandro Forero Cuervo to the autoconf macro repository. We are also
#   grateful for the helpful feedback of numerous users.

# -Kthread: Sequent (threads in libc, but -Kthread needed for pthread.h)
# -kthread: FreeBSD kernel threads (preferred to -pthread since SMP-able)
# lthread: LinuxThreads port on FreeBSD (also preferred to -pthread)
# -pthread: Linux/gcc (kernel threads), BSD/gcc (userland threads)
# -pthreads: Solaris/gcc
# -mthreads: Mingw32/gcc, Lynx/gcc
# -mt: Sun Workshop C (may only link SunOS threads [-lthread], but it
#      doesn't hurt to check since this sometimes defines pthreads too;
#      also defines -D_REENTRANT)
#      ... -mt is also the pthreads flag for HP/aCC
# pthread: Linux, etcetera
# --thread-safe: KAI C++

Wallet Tools
---------------------

### [BitRPC](/contrib/bitrpc) ###
Allows for sending of all standard Bitcoin commands via RPC rather than as command line args.

### [SpendFrom](/contrib/spendfrom) ###

Use the raw transactions API to send coins received on a particular
address (or addresses).

Repository Tools
---------------------

### [Developer tools](/contrib/devtools) ###
Specific tools for developers working on this repository.
Contains the script `github-merge.sh` for merging github pull requests securely and signing them using GPG.

### [Linearize](/contrib/linearize) ###
Construct a linear, no-fork, best version of the blockchain.

### [Qos](/contrib/qos) ###

A Linux bash script that will set up traffic control (tc) to limit the outgoing bandwidth for connections to the Bitcoin network. This means one can have an always-on bitcoind instance running, and another local bitcoind/bitcoin-qt instance which connects to this node and receives blocks from it.

### [Seeds](/contrib/seeds) ###
Utility to generate the pnSeed[] array that is compiled into the client.

Build Tools and Keys
---------------------

### [Debian](/contrib/debian) ###
Contains files used to package bitcoind/bitcoin-qt
for Debian-based Linux systems. If you compile bitcoind/bitcoin-qt yourself, there are some useful files here.

### [Gitian-descriptors](/contrib/gitian-descriptors) ###
Gavin's notes on getting gitian builds up and running using KVM.

### [Gitian-downloader](/contrib/gitian-downloader)
Various PGP files of core developers. 

### [MacDeploy](/contrib/macdeploy) ###
Scripts and notes for Mac builds. 

Test and Verify Tools 
---------------------

### [TestGen](/contrib/testgen) ###
Utilities to generate test vectors for the data-driven Bitcoin tests.

### [Test Patches](/contrib/test-patches) ###
These patches are applied when the automated pull-tester
tests each pull and when master is tested using jenkins.

### [Verify SF Binaries](/contrib/verifysfbinaries) ###
This script attempts to download and verify the signature file SHA256SUMS.asc from SourceForge.

### BitRPC
Allows for sending of all standard Bitcoin commands via RPC rather than as command line args.

### Looking for Wallet Tools?
BitRPC.py is able to do the exact same thing as `walletchangepass.py` and `walletunlock.py`. Their respective commands in BitRPC.py are:

	bitrpc.py walletpassphrasechange
	bitrpc.py walletpassphrase

Debian
====================
This directory contains files used to package tixoncashd/tixoncash-qt
for Debian-based Linux systems. If you compile tixoncashd/tixoncash-qt yourself, there are some useful files here.

## tixoncash: URI support ##


tixoncash-qt.desktop  (Gnome / Open Desktop)
To install:

	sudo desktop-file-install tixoncash-qt.desktop
	sudo update-desktop-database

If you build yourself, you will either need to modify the paths in
the .desktop file or copy or symlink your tixoncashqt binary to `/usr/bin`
and the `../../share/pixmaps/tixoncash128.png` to `/usr/share/pixmaps`

Package: tixoncashd
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Tixoncash is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
 requires 1+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, tixoncashd, and the CLI tool
 tixoncash-cli to interact with the daemon.

Package: tixoncash-qt
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - Qt GUI
 Tixoncash (TXCH) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after
 Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision for Bitcoin. 
 It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional currency designed
 to offer a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase
 in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies.
 Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the
 electricity used by high-powered mining hardware. Tixoncash
 utilizes an en- ergy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm, can be
 mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining
 equipment. The Green Protocol offers a simple solution to
 Bitcoin sustainability issues and provides a faster, more scalable
 blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
 requires 1+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides Tixoncash-Qt, a GUI for Tixoncash based on Qt.

##            Quick Primer on addnode vs connect            ##
##  Let's say for instance you use addnode=4.2.2.4          ##
##  addnode will connect you to and tell you about the      ##
##    nodes connected to 4.2.2.4.  In addition it will tell ##
##    the other nodes connected to it that you exist so     ##
##    they can connect to you.                              ##
##  connect will not do the above when you 'connect' to it. ##
##    It will *only* connect you to 4.2.2.4 and no one else.##
##                                                          ##
##  So if you're behind a firewall, or have other problems  ##
##  finding nodes, add some using 'addnode'.                ##
##                                                          ##
##  If you want to stay private, use 'connect' to only      ##
##  connect to "trusted" nodes.                             ##
##                                                          ##
##  If you run multiple nodes on a LAN, there's no need for ##
##  all of them to open lots of connections.  Instead       ##
##  'connect' them all to one node that is port forwarded   ##
##  and has lots of connections.                            ##
##       Thanks goes to [Noodle] on Freenode.               ##

.SH NAME
tixoncash.conf \- tixoncash configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
All command-line options (except for '\-conf') may be specified in a configuration file, and all configuration file options may also be specified on the command line. Command-line options override values set in the configuration file.
.TP
The configuration file is a list of 'setting=value' pairs, one per line, with optional comments starting with the '#' character.
.TP
The configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it using your favorite plain-text editor. By default, tixoncashd(1) will look for a file named tixoncash.conf(5) in the tixoncash data directory, but both the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed using the '\-datadir' and '\-conf' command-line arguments.

.SH SYNOPSIS
tixoncashd [options] <command> [params]
.TP
tixoncashd [options] help <command> \- Get help for a command
.SH DESCRIPTION
This  manual page documents the tixoncashd program. Tixoncash is a peer-to-peer digital currency. Peer-to-peer (P2P) means that there is no central authority to issue new money or keep track of transactions. Instead, these tasks are managed collectively by the nodes of the network. Advantages:

Tixoncash can be sent easily through the Internet, without having to trust middlemen. Transactions are designed to be irreversible. Be safe from instability caused by fractional reserve banking and central banks. The limited inflation of the Tixoncash system’s money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) throughout the network, not monopolized by banks.

Contents
===========
This directory contains tools for developers working on this repository.

check-doc.py
============

Check if all command line args are documented. The return value indicates the
number of undocumented args.

github-merge.py
===============

A small script to automate merging pull-requests securely and sign them with GPG.

For example:

  ./github-merge.py 3077

(in any git repository) will help you merge pull request #3077 for the
tixoncash/tixoncash repository.

What it does:
* Fetch master and the pull request.
* Locally construct a merge commit.
* Show the diff that merge results in.
* Ask you to verify the resulting source tree (so you can do a make
check or whatever).
* Ask you whether to GPG sign the merge commit.
* Ask you whether to push the result upstream.

This means that there are no potential race conditions (where a
pullreq gets updated while you're reviewing it, but before you click
merge), and when using GPG signatures, that even a compromised GitHub
couldn't mess with the sources.

Setup
---------
Configuring the github-merge tool for the Tixoncash repository is done in the following way:

    git config githubmerge.repository tixoncash/tixoncash
    git config githubmerge.testcmd "make -j4 check" (adapt to whatever you want to use for testing)
    git config --global user.signingkey mykeyid (if you want to GPG sign)

optimize-pngs.py
================

A script to optimize png files in the Tixoncash
repository (requires pngcrush).

fix-copyright-headers.py
===========================

Every year newly updated files need to have its copyright headers updated to reflect the current year.
If you run this script from src/ it will automatically update the year on the copyright header for all
.cpp and .h files if these have a git commit from the current year.

For example a file changed in 2014 (with 2014 being the current year):
```// Copyright (c) 2009-2013 The Bitcoin developers```

would be changed to:
```// Copyright (c) 2009-2014 The Bitcoin developers```

logprint-scanner.py
===================
LogPrint and LogPrintf are known to throw exceptions when the number of arguments supplied to the
LogPrint(f) function is not the same as the number of format specifiers.

Ideally, the presentation of this mismatch would be at compile-time, but instead it is at run-time.

This script scans the src/ directory recursively and looks in each .cpp/.h file and identifies all
errorneous LogPrint(f) calls where the number of arguments do not match.

The filename and line number of the errorneous occurence is given.

The script returns with the number of erroneous occurences as an error code to help facilitate
integration with a continuous integration system.

The script can be ran from any working directory inside the git repository.

symbol-check.py
===============

A script to check that the (Linux) executables produced by gitian only contain
allowed gcc, glibc and libstdc++ version symbols. This makes sure they are
still compatible with the minimum supported Linux distribution versions.

Example usage after a gitian build:

    find ../gitian-builder/build -type f -executable | xargs python contrib/devtools/symbol-check.py

If only supported symbols are used the return value will be 0 and the output will be empty.

If there are 'unsupported' symbols, the return value will be 1 a list like this will be printed:

    .../64/test_tixoncash: symbol memcpy from unsupported version GLIBC_2.14
    .../64/test_tixoncash: symbol __fdelt_chk from unsupported version GLIBC_2.15
    .../64/test_tixoncash: symbol std::out_of_range::~out_of_range() from unsupported version GLIBCXX_3.4.15
    .../64/test_tixoncash: symbol _ZNSt8__detail15_List_nod from unsupported version GLIBCXX_3.4.15

update-translations.py
======================

Run this script from the root of the repository to update all translations from transifex.
It will do the following automatically:

- fetch all translations
- post-process them into valid and committable format
- add missing translations to the build system (TODO)

See doc/translation-process.md for more information.

[  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation](  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation)
... see there for complete details.

You need the right hardware: you need a 64-bit-capable CPU with hardware virtualization support (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). Not all modern CPUs support hardware virtualization.

You probably need to enable hardware virtualization in your machine's BIOS.

You need to be running a recent version of 64-bit-Ubuntu, and you need to install several prerequisites:

	sudo apt-get install ruby apache2 git apt-cacher-ng python-vm-builder qemu-kvm

Sanity checks:

	sudo service apt-cacher-ng status  # Should return apt-cacher-ng is running
	ls -l /dev/kvm   # Should show a /dev/kvm device


Once you've got the right hardware and software:

    git clone git://github.com/tixoncash/tixoncash.git
    git clone git://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder.git
    mkdir gitian-builder/inputs
    cd gitian-builder/inputs

    # Create base images
    cd gitian-builder
    bin/make-base-vm --suite trusty --arch amd64
    cd ..

    # Get inputs (see doc/release-process.md for exact inputs needed and where to get them)
    ...

    # For further build instructions see doc/release-notes.md
    ...

---------------------

`gitian-builder` now also supports building using LXC. See
[  https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/lxc.html](  https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/lxc.html)
... for how to get LXC up and running under Ubuntu.

If your main machine is a 64-bit Mac or PC with a few gigabytes of memory
and at least 10 gigabytes of free disk space, you can `gitian-build` using
LXC running inside a virtual machine.

Here's a description of Gavin's setup on OSX 10.6:

1. Download and install VirtualBox from [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

2. Download the 64-bit Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 LTS .iso CD image from
   [http://www.ubuntu.com/](http://www.ubuntu.com/)

3. Run VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine, using the Ubuntu .iso (see the [VirtualBox documentation](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Documentation) for details). Create it with at least 2 gigabytes of memory and a disk that is at least 20 gigabytes big.

4. Inside the running Ubuntu desktop, install:

	sudo apt-get install debootstrap lxc ruby apache2 git apt-cacher-ng python-vm-builder

5. Still inside Ubuntu, tell gitian-builder to use LXC, then follow the "Once you've got the right hardware and software" instructions above:

	export USE_LXC=1
	git clone git://github.com/tixoncash/tixoncash.git
	... etc
